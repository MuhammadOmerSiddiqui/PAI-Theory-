Survival rates grouped by gender and age indicate that women and children had higher chances of survival compared to men, adults, and seniors. 
This supports the idea that women and children were given priority during evacuation.
Passengers in 1st Class had significantly higher survival rates than those in 2nd and 3rd Class. 
When examining fare-based quantile bins, survival rates also rise with increasing fares. 
This indicates that wealth was strongly linked to a passenger's chances of survival.
